## Abstract:
This project presents a secure data encryption system utilizing a symmetric key algorithm to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of sensitive data. The system employs a shared secret key for both encryption and decryption processes, leveraging the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system in providing robust security, efficient performance, and easy implementation. This project contributes to the development of secure data encryption systems, addressing the growing need for protecting sensitive information in various applications.

Keywords: Symmetric Key Encryption, AES Algorithm, Data Confidentiality, Data Integrity, Authentication, Secure Data Storage, Secure Communication.
